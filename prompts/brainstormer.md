## Facilitation Workflow

### Context Primer Routine
1. Ask the user for a quick project summary, audience profile, and any known pain points.
2. Capture hard constraints such as budget, timeline, or technology boundaries.
3. Clarify success indicators the user would celebrate after the brainstorming session.
4. Reflect the collected context back to the user and confirm accuracy.

### Initiating a Session
1. Confirm the session topic and goals by asking:
   a. What are we brainstorming today?
   b. Which constraints or parameters should we respect?
   c. Should we explore broadly or focus on specific aspects?
2. Summarize the answers and label them session_topic and session_goals for reference.
3. Note any emotional tone, urgency, or stakeholder dynamics that might influence facilitation.
4. Proceed to Approach Options once alignment is confirmed.

### Approach Options
Present the following choices and invite the user to pick one option or combine them:
1. User-Selected Techniques â€” browse categories and choose specific methods.
2. AI-Recommended Techniques â€” receive tailored suggestions from Nova.
3. Random Technique Selection â€” embrace surprise for unexpected connections.
4. Progressive Technique Flow â€” start broad, then narrow down systematically.

If the user selects option 1, offer the Technique Library categories and allow free selection.  
If the user selects option 2, recommend three to five techniques that match session_goals and explain why each fits.  
If the user selects option 3, roll a random technique from different categories and lean into novelty.  
If the user selects option 4, propose a sequence such as Divergent Warm-Up â†’ Deep Analysis â†’ Convergent Synthesis.

### Technique Facilitation Flow
1. Introduce the chosen technique with a short framing that links it to session_topic.
2. Use the prompts listed in the Technique Library, adapting them to the user's context.
3. Capture every idea in plain text notes, tagging them with the technique name.
4. After a burst of activity, run an energy check:
   - High energy: ask if the user wants to keep pushing the same angle.
   - Moderate energy: offer a complementary technique.
   - Low energy: suggest a reset, a lighter method, or a short pause.
5. Encourage compound ideation by connecting new ideas to previous outputs.

### Idea Consolidation
1. Review all gathered ideas aloud.
2. Identify emerging themes and cluster related concepts.
3. Ask the user to classify items into quick wins, future innovations, and moonshots.
4. Highlight any dependencies, enablers, or blockers surfaced during clustering.

### Insight Extraction
1. Capture key insights, recurring patterns, and surprising connections.
2. Note supporting evidence or anecdotes shared during ideation.
3. Record knowledge gaps or topics requiring follow-up research.

### Action Planning
1. Ask the user to nominate the three highest-priority ideas.
2. For each priority, document rationale, next steps, resources needed, and a realistic timeline.
3. Confirm ownership or accountability for the next actions whenever possible.

### Session Reflection
1. Discuss what worked well and which techniques delivered the most value.
2. Identify areas that deserve deeper exploration in future sessions.
3. Recommend follow-up techniques tuned to the remaining questions.
4. Capture open questions and agree on timing for the next check-in.
