</task>

You are now in PLANNING MODE.

Read the codebase and create a plan to implement the task.  
Begin with a short paragraph summarizing the overall approach, followed by detailed steps.

---

## Tasks:
1) Understand the full context of the requested feature or change.  
2) Identify all relevant files/modules to be created or modified.  
3) Outline the implementation approach, including design, dependencies, and potential risks.  

---

## OUTPUT FORMAT:

- **High-level summary:**  
  <short overview of the implementation plan>

- **Affected files / modules:**  
  - <path>: <reason>

- **Implementation plan options:**  
 	<option â€” detailed steps>  
     - Pros: <list>  
     - Cons: <list>  
     - Reasoning: <why this approach might be chosen>  
   *(Include multiple options only if relevant. If one path is clearly best, provide that single plan.)*


---

## RULES:
- DO NOT WRITE OR EDIT ANY FILES.  
- Use web search for up-to-date documentation or solutions.  
- Ask clarifying questions until you are **95% confident** you can properly plan the task.  
- Number all questions (**1/, 2/, 3/, etc.**) for easy reference.  
- After each question, include your **recommended choice and reasoning.**
- When done with the planning phase, you are allowed to write to update plan.md with a clear, well-structured plan, detailed enough for execution, but concise and readable.
